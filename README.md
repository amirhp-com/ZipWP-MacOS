# **ZipWP Quick Actions for macOS Finder**

This repository contains a set of macOS Finder Quick Actions designed to streamline the process of creating WordPress plugins and source archives. These Quick Actions allow you to quickly zip a folder, removing unnecessary files, and automatically setting a version suffix on the archive. The tools are perfect for developers who need a fast and reliable way to prepare WordPress plugins for distribution.

## **Why This Project?**

If you've ever compressed a folder on macOS and tried to use that zip file as a WordPress plugin, you might have noticed that it doesn't always work as expected. Extra files and folders (like `.DS_Store`) often get included, and the folder structure may not be ideal. This project aims to solve these problems by automating the process, ensuring you always get a clean, versioned zip file ready for WordPress.

## **Features**

- **ZipWP Plugin**: Creates a zip file of the selected folder as a ready-to-install WordPress plugin. The version is automatically detected from your files, and you can edit it via a popup.
- **ZipWP Source**: Archives the entire source code while preserving the folder structure. The version suffix is appended to the zip file.
- **ZipWP Plugin Quick**: Instantly creates a share-ready zip file without prompting for the version.

These Quick Actions are designed to eliminate the hassle of manually removing unnecessary files such as `.git`, `.gitignore`, `.vscode`, `.DS_Store`, and others, ensuring a clean and lightweight plugin package.

## **Getting Started**

### **Installation & Setup**

1. **Clone this repository** to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amirhp-com/ZipWP-MacOS.git
   ```

2. **Add the Quick Actions** to macOS Automator:

   - Open **Automator**.
   - Choose **Quick Action**.
   - Drag and drop the relevant script from the cloned repository into the workflow area.
   - Set **Workflow receives current** to `files or folders in Finder`.
   - **Set pass input**: `as arguments`
   - Save the Quick Action with a name like `ZipWP Plugin`, `ZipWP Source`, or `ZipWP Plugin Quick`.

3. **Assign Icons to Quick Actions**:

### **Using the Quick Actions**

1. **Right-click** on the folder containing the WordPress plugin or source code.
2. **Select** the desired Quick Action from the `Quick Actions` menu:

   - **ZipWP Plugin**: Opens a popup asking for the plugin version. The detected version is pre-filled, but you can edit it.
   - **ZipWP Source**: Similar to ZipWP Plugin, but preserves the entire source code structure.
   - **ZipWP Plugin Quick**: Instantly creates a versioned zip file without further input.

3. **Locate the generated zip file** in the same directory as your original folder.

### **Example Workflow**

   - Right-click on your plugin folder.
   - Choose `ZipWP Plugin` from Quick Actions.
